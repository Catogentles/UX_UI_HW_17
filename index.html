            I  am a UX/UI designer on a quest toward building my career as a designer. 
            Creativity,  empathy,  and  knack  for  problem  solving  are  my  strengths.  
            My professional  background   has  been dedicated  to  the  military  as  an 
            operations  manager  and a nurse.   I have live all  over  the  US and 
            internationally all  while  raising  a  family;  these  life  experiences  
            have  lead  me to  UX/UI.   I  plan  to  bring  all  I  have  learned  as  
            a  UX/UI  designer,  apply  the design  thinking  process,  and  draw  from  
            my  life  experiences  to  help  drive  the success  of  my design teams. <br>
            <br>
